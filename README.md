# WrongRails

I like [Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails).

I like [wrong](https://github.com/sconover/wrong).

I'd like them to be friends.

`WrongRails` introduces `wrong` to `Rails` projects in a friendly way.

## Usage

In your `Gemfile` add:

```ruby
gem 'wrong_rails', group: :test
```

Run `bundle` and now you'll have `wrong`'s block-enabled `assert` available in your tests and/or specs.

Easy!
